SUMMARY
=======

A quick python script to accept incoming MQTT payloads under the topic of /raw/, and look them up in a table for republishing under a logical topic name

It stems from a suggestion by Robert at http://blog.hekkers.net/2012/09/18/mqtt-about-dumb-sensors-topics-and-clean-code/ to try and organize disparate sources into one logical hierarchy. 

Anything that is published under /raw/ but does not match anything in the map gets republished with /unknown/ prepended to the topic.

Some examples of source data I have...

/raw/flat.vpn.glasgownet.com/ups/voltage -> /bishopbriggs/gordonhouse/electricity/voltage
/raw/flat.vpn.glasgownet.com/meterpulsecounter/watts -> /bishopbriggs/gordonhouse/electricity/watts
/raw/weather1.vpn.glasgownet.com/weather/outside_temp -> /milngavie/parentshouse/garden/temperature
/raw/weather1.vpn.glasgownet.com/weather/inside_temp -> /milngavie/parentshouse/sunlounge/temperature
/raw/wmlp1000/apci/core_temp -> /mobile/wmlp1000/cpu_temp

INSTALL
=======

mkdir /usr/local/mqtt-republisher/ /etc/mqtt-republisher/
cd /usr/local/
git clone git://github.com/kylegordon/mqtt-republisher.git
cp mqtt-republisher.init /etc/init.d/mqtt-republisher
cp map.csv /etc/mqtt-republisher/
cp mqtt-republisher.cfg.example /etc/mqtt-republisher/mqtt-republisher.cfg
update-rc.d mqtt-republisher defaults
cp mqtt-republisher.default /etc/default/mqtt-republisher

Edit /etc/mqtt-republisher/map.csv and /etc/mqtt-republisher/mqtt-republisher.cfg to suit, and then

/etc/init.d/mqtt-republisher start
