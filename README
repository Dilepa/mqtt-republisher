A quick python script to accept incoming MQTT payloads under the topic of /raw/, and look them up in a table for republishing under a logical topic name

TODO
Some sort of lookup table, as described at http://blog.hekkers.net/2012/09/18/mqtt-about-dumb-sensors-topics-and-clean-code/

/raw/mode/method/address/data to /location/house/room/parameter

Some examples of source data I have...

/raw/flat.vpn.glasgownet.com/ups/voltage -> /bishopbriggs/gordonhouse/voltage
/raw/flat.vpn.glasgownet.com/meterpulsecounter/watts -> /bishopbriggs/gordonhouse/watts
/raw/weather1.vpn.glasgownet.com/weather/outside_temp -> /milngavie/parentshouse/outside_temp
/raw/weather1.vpn.glasgownet.com/weather/inside_temp -> /milngavie/parentshouse/sunlounge_temp
